# Global sale option for all products in a WooCommerce shop
The wc-global-sale.php file contains the final result of a tutorial on how to create an option in the WooCommerce Product Settings panel to set a discount in percentage for all the products in the store.

In the example, we add to the WooCommerce Product Settings page a number field that allows the shop manager to define a percentage of discount for all the products in the store, and a checkbox to easily apply or disable the discount.

This code is for demonstration purposes. If you wish to have more control over your global sale, such as being able to define a fixed discount instead of a percentage, a date range for the sale, or exclude categories, products and tags, I recommend using a plugin such as [Storewide Sale For WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/products/storewide-sale-for-woocommerce/) (paid) or [Algoritmika Ltd's Global Shop Discount for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/global-shop-discount-for-woocommerce/) (free). I have not tested nor I am affiliated to either in any way.
